## üèÜ Contributions
- To our knowledge, eMotions is the first dataset for emotion recognition in SVs. The more reliable annotated emotions can promote future studies in this field.  
- We propose an effective baseline AV-CPNet to recognize the emotions in SVs. We design the corresponding components to complementarily model the audio-visual correlations and leverage the emotion-polarity information to better guide model optimization.
- Extensive experimental results on nine datasets verify the superiority of our proposed model and provide detailed insights into different approaches and modalities for future works.
